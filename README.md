## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I have learned using figma as a tool to implement a given
design.

Furthermore, it was my first real project outside of tutorials. Therefore it
deepened my knowledge on a lot of subjects such as flexbox, media-queries, the
mobile-first approach and solving all those small problems that come up using
mans best friend, Google.

Last but not least I have learned using version control (Git and Github) and the
Git command line interface specifically. This will definitely come in handy in
later projects.

### Continued development

In future projects I want to use CSS grid rather than flexbox to learn about it
more. Also, I want to add more breakpoints to make it more responsive.

I discovered that it can be pretty hard to name things correctly, even in such a
small project. Therefore, I am going to use the BEM (Block Element Modifier)
methodology in the next project to make the code easier to read and use.

For bigger projects I want to use custom properties (variables) in css to make
the code more reusable.

Maybe I am going to use a CSS-preprocessor like SASS next time around. I
definitely want to learn about it in the near future.
